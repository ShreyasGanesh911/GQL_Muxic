# A Basic GraphQL Project
This is my first **GraphQL** project, where I have used GQL to query and mutate data stored in MongoDB.
The project consists of the following types:
*  **User**: Application users
*  **Artist**: Info. about the artist name, songs and albums
*  **Track**: Info. about the song name, duration and associated album and artist
*  **Album**: Rep. collection of tracks
*  **Playlist**: User saved tracks
